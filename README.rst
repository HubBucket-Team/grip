``grip`` -- A Go Library for Logging and Error Handling
=======================================================

*Under Construction*

``grip`` isn't any thing special, but it does a few pretty great
things:

#. Provide a common logging interface to log to both standard
   logging methods and/or ``systemd`` journal components.

#. Provides some simple methods for handling errors, particularly when
   you want to accumulate and then return errors.
